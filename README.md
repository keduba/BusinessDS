# Business Case

The tasks represented in this repository are all related to business use cases in data science. They also serve to show how projects can be structured and approached from a business perspective.

I worked on them, and they are not my original ideas but I found them because it was important to approach data science not as a collection of models and metrics but as a tool to solve problems for businesses.

Some of the code is adapted because I wanted to know how things work underneath the wrappers. That way it's eaiser to know when one method can be swapped out for another.

I hope it's useful to you if you discover it. Each notebook is attributed to the source where I first found it.
